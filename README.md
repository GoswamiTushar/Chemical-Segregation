# Challenge - Chemicals Segregation

## Can you Separate the chemicals? (Binary Classification Challenge)

A chemist has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals. He extracted 3 features 
- Feature0
- Feature1
- Feature2 

from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. 

You are provided with the results derived by the chemist and your task is to create a model that will label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features.

# Data Description!

You are provided with two files test and train. 

Train: This files consists of two csv files LogisticXtrain and LogisticYtrain. Xtrain consists of the features whereas Ytrain consists of the labels associated with the features.

Test: This file consists of a file LogisticXtest consisting of the features of test data. You need to format your solution into csv with a title of "label" on it.

The algorithm i.e. Logistic Regression is used here is build from scratch. You can use any sklearn based classifier too for the same.


The number of rows must be equal to given test cases and number of columns must be equal to the columns given in the sample submission file.

### Dependencies

```sh
$ pip install numpy
